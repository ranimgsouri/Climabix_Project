Welcome to our project. The weather and accident data anaysis project focuses on
 developing a comprehensive system for data analysis, prediction, and user interaction,
 incorporating various technologies and methodologies. Starting with weather and
 accident data, we conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover relationships and
 correlations between variables such as weather conditions (visibility, wind speed,
 temperature, pressure) and accident severity. 
Through visualization tools and regression models, we aimed to derive insights and
 make predictions about accident outcomes based on environmental factors. The
 project also included data ingestion pipelines to clean, manage, and process multiple
 datasets efficiently. To enhance usability, we implemented a user management
 system using abstraction and polymorphism to define distinct roles such as
 administrators, data scientists, and viewers, each with tailored access to components
 like visualization tools and data cleaning modules. 
The system was further developed into a full-fledged web application using Spring
 Boot, with a basic front-end built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This front-end
 allows users to interact with the system intuitively, managing roles, performing
 operations. The purpose of this project is to create a scalable and user-friendly
 platform for analyzing, predicting, and interacting with data to support informed
 decision-making and risk management
